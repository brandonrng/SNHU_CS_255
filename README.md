Driver pass is a web-based drivers course service for learning drivers. The client was someone who saw an opportunity for business as most people do not pass their DMV test the first time. The client has a secretary and IT lead. The system needed to be accessible to these individuals and managed by them 24/7 even when offline. 

I think using a rest API for this was the best choice for the client. I have especially considered the end user for this, and it should be an easy and secure experience for them.

If I need to improve anything I think it would be the use case diagram because it is an overall depiction of the complete experience and I think my diagram could use some more work to show just that.

The user is the end consumer of this service, and it is important to note that not only students will be using this service but instructors and administrators as well. Each user should have an experience catered to them based on the role they hold. This is important to do because it would be a bad or incomplete experience if letâ€™s say the student is given a button to upload new course content but cannot use the set button. There is no point in showing this button to the student as it spoils the end experience.

When designing software, always start at the chalkboard. Gather all the requirements, get all your questions answered, and begin a rough draft design using your various UML diagrams. Having constant meetings for feedback or approval with the client is important for time saving and end user satisfaction.
